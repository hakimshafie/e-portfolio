 <p>This will be the first ever webpage i've ever created eventhough it is a task for
 my assignment but I enjoyed much doing this. With helps from my lovely lecturer 
 MDM DR. Rashidah Mokhtar in exploring html . Firstly, I wanted to thanks to my lecturer
 teaching and showing as much as she knows to get me and my friends understand on
 how html works.</p>

 About me ,Im a students of Uitm Segamat .Im taking Computer Science Course and enjoying 
 it much. You can check out <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/uitmsegamat/"> Uitm Segamat</a> 
 facebook page.This is <a name = "opinion"> <ins>my opinion</ins></a> on ODL class.As im on my 
 last semester for now .Im a bit dissapointed ,it is because firstly im studying at Segamat only for 3 semesters then we faced a pandaemic issues that is 
 "COVID 19". Secondly , we as a student and lecturer have to do an ODL class which I 
 dont like much as we cannot be in a class study physically and make it hard for students
 and lecturers knows each others.Im hoping thatthis pandaemic issues will end soon . To know 
 about me click at the buttons up there .
